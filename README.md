# Convergence-diagnostics-for-MCMC
Two Markov chains were generated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and were tested using the Graphical method, Effective sample size, Geweke, Heidelberger and Welchand Gelman-Rubin diagnostic methods. Some of these methods used batch means to estimate the Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE) and Spectral Variance Estimator to estimate variance when autocorrelation coefficients are large.

# Convergence-diagnostics-for-MCMC
Two Markov chains were generated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and were tested using the Graphical method, Effective sample size, Geweke, Heidelberger and Welchand Gelman-Rubin diagnostic methods. Some of these methods used batch means to estimate the Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE) and Spectral Variance Estimator to estimate variance when autocorrelation coefficients are large.

See the report for details.
